PyTorch Implementation of ResNet

This repo consists of an implementation the ResNet model (He et. al 2015) using the PyTorch framework.  The model was tested using 

The ResNet is a modification of the original VGG-19 net with additional skip connections which help alleiviate the vanishing gradient problem.  As a result, deeper networks can be designed with grea
