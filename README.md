**PyTorch Implementation of ResNet**

This repo consists of an implementation the ResNet model (He et. al 2015) using the PyTorch library.  The model was tested using a dataset of 7000 Pokemon (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification).  The model was also verified against the built-in versions of ResNet and behaved comparablely with an accuracy ~75%.  The overally accuracy significantly improved to ~95% when pretrained weights were used suggesting the model accuracy can be significantly improved using a larger dataset.

The ResNet is a modification of the original VGG-19 net with additional skip connections that help address the vanishing gradient problem.  Generally, networks become more difficult to train as the number of hidden layers is increased due to the vanishing gradient problem, where gradient values become exponentially smaller as one progresses further through the network.  However, this problem has can be alleviated by introducing so-called 'shortcut connections', which recasts the training problem to the optimization of a residual mapping instead of a direct mapping between the network predictions and ground truth.  The shortcut connections consist of adding the input directly to the output so that the output is formally written as $\mathcal{F}(x) + x$.
